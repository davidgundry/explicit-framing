Analysing dataset data 

Hypothesis 1:  With high experimental framing, a greater proportion of the data will be accurate
    A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test will be used to test whether the distribution of Accuracy
    differs significantly between the +Framing condition than the -Framing condition. α = 0.05
High-framing mean 0.46381578947368424 sd 0.32020574623952647
Low-framing mean 0.4725 sd 0.2882587591815693
Mann-Whitney U test: p = 0.8095075448992477 ; U = 1386.0 ; significant = False ; d = -0.02840642601992573 


Hypothesis 2:  With experimental framing, participants will enjoy the game less
    A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of Enjoyment
    are greater in the low-framing condition than the high-framing condition. α = 0.05.
High-framing mean 3.3283208020050123 sd 0.3306113608524513
Low-framing mean 3.2885714285714287 sd 0.2835045745928574
two tailed t test: p = 0.5089233960309905 ; t = 0.6627805891555669 ; significant = False ; d = 0.1284219439379256 


Hypothesis 3:  Manipulation check: With high experimental framing, participants will
    experience the game with an 'experiment' frame rather than a 'play' frame.
    A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of Play Framing
    are greater in the low-framing condition than the high-framing condition. α = 0.05.
