Analysing dataset data 

Hypothesis 1:  With high experimental framing, a greater proportion of the data will be accurate
    A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test will be used to test whether the distribution of Accuracy
    differs significantly between the +Framing condition than the -Framing condition. α = 0.05
Game mean 0.03333333333333333 sd 0.04714045207910317
mean Tool 0.03333333333333333 sd 0.04714045207910317
Mann-Whitney U test: p = 0.33250277105101456 ; U = 2.0 ; significant = False ; d = 0.0 


Hypothesis 2:  With experimental framing, participants will enjoy the game less
    A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of Enjoyment
    are greater in the low-framing condition than the high-framing condition. α = 0.05.

two tailed t test: p = 0.05131670194948626 ; t = -4.242640687119282 ; significant = False ; d = -4.242640687119282 


Hypothesis 3:  Manipulation check: With high experimental framing, participants will
    experience the game with an 'experiment' frame rather than a 'play' frame.
    A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of Play Framing
    are greater in the low-framing condition than the high-framing condition. α = 0.05.
