# Effect of Experiment Framing on Game Data

Previous work shows delivering experiments as games increases participant enjoyment but it decreases the accuracy of the data collected. This study will determine whether there is an effect of explicit experimental framing (the task being metacommunicatively framed as an experiment vs. a game) on the accuracy of the data collected and the enjoyment.

## Hypotheses

1. With high experimental framing, a greater proportion of the data will be accurate
2. With high experimental framing, participants will enjoy the game less
3. Manipulation check: With high experimental framing, participants will experience the game with an 'experiment' frame rather than a 'play' frame.

Design Plan
-----------

## Study Type

Between-participant experiment.

Participants will be assigned automatically by the game, making this a double-blind experiment.

Sampling Plan
-------------

### Existing Data

As of the date of submission of this research plan for preregistration, the data have not yet been collected.

### Data collection procedures

Particpants will be assigned to either a High-Framing or Low-Framing condition. 

### Sample Size

148 participants will be recruited from Prolific. The following filters will apply:

1. Age > 18
2. First langauge English
3. Have not participated in any of my previous studies

### Sample Size Rationale

See the file `power-analysis.Rout`.

### Stopping Rule

Participants are assigned at random. If there are less than 74 participants in either of the conditions after the original sample size has been recruited (after exclusion criteria have been applied), we will increase the sample size in blocks of 5 until this condition is met. We will not recruit more than 168 participants in total, however.

Variables
---------

### Manipulated Variable

We will manipulate the information and instructions given to participants at the start of the experiment. There were two conditions:

**High-Framing:** In the High-Framing condition, participants will be told that for the experiment we want to observe the word order that they prefer when describing shapes.

**Low-Framing:** In the Low-Framing condition, participants will not be told we are interested in word order.

### Measured Variables

**Accuracy**: Accuracy will be measured as the proportion of data collected that corresponds to standard English word order.

**Enjoyment**: Enjoyment will be measured using the Intrinsic Motivation Inventoy: Enjoyment Subscale. (Deci and Ryan, n.d.)

**Play Framing** Play Framing will be measured with adapted versions of the "Direct Play" questions of the Play Experience Scale (Pavlas et al. 2012):

1. When I was using the game, it felt like I was playing rather than doing an experiment
2. I would characterize my experience with the game as playing
3. I was playing a game rather than doing an experiment
4. (R) Using the game felt like doing an experiment 

Analysis Plan
-------------

**Hypothesis 1**: A two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test will be used to test whether the distribution of Accuracy differs significantly between the high-framing condition than the low-framing condition. α = 0.05

**Hypothesis 2**: A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of Enjoyment are greater in the low-framing condition than the high-framing condition. α = 0.05.

**Hypothesis 3**: A two-tailed two-sample t-test will be used to test whether the mean scores of Play Framing are greater in the low-framing condition than the high-framing condition. α = 0.05.

## Exclusion Criteria

The following will be excluded:

1. Participants reporting their age as under 18
2. Participants reporting their first langauge as other than English.
3. Incomplete records will be excluded.
4. Participants with fewer than 13 moves
