Prolific
- How is the study presented, labelled, framed on Prolific itself? Can you check and revise all the language there as well?

High framing condition (I assume this is high experimental framing :)

* Consent Form
    - The Consent form still says "play a puzzle game" at the top: change into “Use an app”
    - Consent form says "the design of "applied games". Task says "You will play a puzzle game." Reword this throughout for high framing: "Our research studies the design of interactive media for collecting user data. This study investigates how the presentation of an interactive app influences the way people engage with it." Task: "You will use an interactive app for 8 minutes. There is a tutorial that will show you how to use it."

>> I see the point about self-selection bias. Do we have to fill in a Prolific consent form and then a separate York consent form? In that case, can we drop the Prolific consent form?

>>>If not, and to avoid the self-selection bias, I would suggest the wording on Prolific for the task and for the consent form is neutral/experimental and talks about an “interactive app”.

 

* Text frames:
    - "Applied Game Experiment" overlay: Change into "Interactive Media Experiment". "Your contribution will help us find ways to collect scientific data with interactive apps. We ask you to engage with this app for 8 minutes ..."
    - "Applied Game Experiment" survey: Relabel this "Interactive Media Experiment", put at the end of data collection, not at the beginning (the "how often do you play digital games?" question evokes a framing.)
    - "Start experiment" -> this is the screen I would try and turn into a big splash separator. Again, the language in high framing still carries lots of gaming language. Rephrase: "You will now see an experimental task designed to identify grammatical preferences. In this experiment, you will interact with the app for 8 minutes while we record the inputs that you make."

* Within the game:
    - Change language: Instead of "good job, you cleared the level." Say "Good job, you cleared the task."
    - Throughout all screens, replace "level" with "task"
    - "Clear 3 adjacent blocks for an extra move" instead of "bonus move"
    - Transition after tutorial: "You've got it! Let's play!" Change into "You've got it! Let's continue"
    - In the level feedback "Level cleared", write "Task completed”, “Task X, "Difficulty multiplier", and "next task". Remove the stars if you can. //TODO: should we replace stars, as otherwise we only change text. Removing stars means we are taking a way a game feature, not just re-describing it.
    - Level 2 and following overlays: It shows "9" and a square shape", I have no idea what that means.
    - "Activity complete": Reword "Thank you for participating in the experimental task."

* Dependent variables, play scale
    - A major issue here is that items 1,2,4 say "game." When I was using the game, etc." Reword items 1,2,4 in both conditions: "When I was using the app", "I would characterise my experience with the app as playing", "Using the app felt like ..."
    - Ask for enjoyment/IMI first, then for play framing, else even asking for play framing sets up demand effects ;).
